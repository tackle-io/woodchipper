## Naming a LoggingContext

When a `LoggingContext` exits, it emits a log message saying so. That message includes the module and function in
which the `LoggingContext` was defined. You may want to customize that name to something more understandable. To do
this, provide a single positional argument to `LoggingContext` when you define it. That name will be used instead.

{{< highlight python "lineNos=true,anchorLineNos=true,lineAnchors=namingloggingcontext" >}}
with LoggingContext("custom-name", user=request.user.id):
{{< /highlight >}}

When this context exits, the message will use the custom name instead of the module and function name.

{{< highlight shell "lineNos=true,anchorLineNos=true,lineAnchors=namingloggingcontextoutput" >}}
2022-01-20 10:49.54 [info     ] Exiting context: custom-name [woodchipper.context] context.time_to_run_Î¼sec=1318 func_name=<module> lineno=1 module=<stdin> user=1000
{{< /highlight >}}

## Namespacing context variables with a prefix

Woodchipper supports organizing the keys of a structured log message into namespaces, separated the namespace prefix
from the key name by a `.`.

You can set the default namespace for all contextual logging keys you set in your application by setting the
environment variable `WOODCHIPPER_KEY_PREFIX` to the prefix value. For example, if you set `WOODCHIPPER_KEY_PREFIX` to
`tackle` and emitted a log message like `logger.info("Message", data=100)`, the output would append the prefix to the
key name, so it became `tackle.data` instead of simply `data`.

You can also set the prefix on a `LoggingContext`, overriding the default key prefix, with the `_prefix` kwarg. For
example:

{{< highlight shell "lineNos=true,anchorLineNos=true,lineAnchors=prefix" >}}
with LoggingContext(user=request.user.id, _prefix="demo"):
    logging.info("Demo beginning.")
{{< /highlight >}}

In the above message, the `user` contextual key would be outputted as `demo.user`, regardless of the value of the
`WOODCHIPPER_KEY_PREFIX` environment variable.

## Using Woodchipper with Flask

Woodchipper ships with a built-in Flask integration, which wraps the entire request/response cycle in a
`LoggingContext`, which adds headers and other basic request information to the context, including a unique ID for
each request. Each of the keys in the context added by this integration will be prefixed with `http`.

To enable the Flask integration, you have to modify the `Flask` app isntance. This is non-standard versus other Flask
extensions, where you simply wrap the Flask object.

{{< highlight python "lineNos=true,anchorLineNos=true,lineAnchors=flask" >}}
from flask import Flask
from woodchipper.http.flask import WoodchipperFlask

app = Flask(__name__)
flask.WoodchipperFlask(app).chipperize()
{{< /highlight >}}

The `WoodchipperFlask` constructor also takes an optional kwarg parameter `request_id_factory`. By passing to this
parameter an argumentless callable, you can customize how the unique request ID is generated.

## Using Woodchipper with AWS Lambda

Woodchipper ships with a built-in AWS Lambda integration when using [Zappa](https://github.com/Zappa/zappa), which
wraps the entire Lambda dispatch cycle in a `LoggingContext`, adding to the context information about the Lambda
execution environment. Each of the keys in the context added by this integration will be prefixed with `lambda`.

To enable the Lambda integration, you have to use it like a WSGI middleware.

{{< highlight python "lineNos=true,anchorLineNos=true,lineAnchors=lambda" >}}
# Let's say your WSGI callable is named app
from woodchipper.http.awslambda import WoodchipperLambda

app = WoodchipperLambda(app)

# If you're using Flask, wrapping the WSGI callable looks like this

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = WoodchipperLambda(app.wsgi_app)
{{< /highlight >}}

## Using Woodchipper with Sentry
There is an optional dependency for [structlog-sentry](https://github.com/kiwicom/structlog-sentry) that can be install
using `pip install woodchipper[sentry]`. If you're using the `JSONLogToStdout` configuration and have the optional dependency installed, Woodchipper will handle emitting error-level log
messages from your application to Sentry. You are still responsible for configuring the Sentry SDK yourself.

**NOTE** As of right now we do not support structlog-sentry >= 2.0.0. If you installed `structlog-sentry` before it was added
as an optional dependency make sure you have it pinned to a version below 2.0.0.
